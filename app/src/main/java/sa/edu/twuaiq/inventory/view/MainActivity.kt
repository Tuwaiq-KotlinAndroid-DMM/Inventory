/***
 * Navigation Graph
Navigation graph is an XML file which shows you how the Fragments are related to each other.
It contains the Fragments Destinations, routes, arguments, action, etc.
Using the Navigation graph you can quickly set the Transition Animation by setting up some attributes.

 * A Navigation Graph consists of:
 * Destinations: The individual screens the user can navigate to and can specify arguments,
   actions and deep link URLs to these destinations.
 * Actions: The routes user can take between your appâ€™s destinations.
   Which are represented by the arrow sign in the Design view.

 * Navigation Host Fragment
In our Activity layout, we have to add a fragment as NavHost and need to define, Where the NavHostFragment finds the navigation graph.
You can see the following code in which we define the fragment as NavHostFragment and also define the navigation graph.

NavController is the class which deals with the FragmentManager or FragmentTransaction.
NavController manages application navigation with the NavHostFragment.
Navigation flow and destination are determined by the navigation graph owned by the NavController class.
And currently running NavHostFragment directly deal with maintaining back-stack,
action bar, toolbar, navigation drawer icon, etc
